Marble is a web application that helps users plan and manage their software projects. It provides an AI-powered planning tool to help define project requirements, generate development plans, and track progress.

## Features

- Create new project plans with AI assistance
- Define project details including name, description, target audience, and value proposition
- Outline user experience journeys
- Get AI-generated technical recommendations and development plans
- Find similar projects for inspiration
- Track project progress through a dashboard
- Enhanced competitor search with visualized progress
- Caching mechanism for AI-generated responses
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Decorative marble blocks background on the dashboard for enhanced visual appeal
- Consistent header design across all pages with clickable logo for easy navigation
- Code editor with Claude 3.7 AI-powered code generation capabilities
- Simplified code preview directly on the project page

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- Firebase (Authentication and Firestore)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui component library
- Anthropic Claude 3.7 for AI-powered code generation
- OpenAI Web Search for competitor research
- Monaco Editor for code editing

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ESLint Configuration

The project includes an ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.json) that sets specific rules for the codebase:
- TypeScript unused variables are set to "warn" instead of "error"
- React Hook dependency rules are set to "warn"

- Implemented AI-powered code generation for project scaffolding
- Built a file explorer for managing project files
- Added robust JSON response parsing with automatic error correction
- Created fallback mechanisms for when AI services are unavailable

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase and AI service configurations:

```
# Firebase configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id

# AI services
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
```

## Development Philosophy

This project is built incrementally, starting with the most basic version and adding features step by step to ensure a solid understanding of all components and functionality.

## User Experience

The project creation process follows a natural, conversational flow:

1. Users select the type of project they're building (website or mobile app)
2. They fill in a narrative-style form that feels like completing a paragraph about their project
   - Each field has a "magic button" that generates AI-powered content suggestions
   - Voice input is available for all fields via the microphone button
3. They describe the user journey using an interactive card-based interface with reorderable steps
4. The AI generates a personalized response with recommendations
5. Users can optionally search for similar successful projects for inspiration
6. Users can preview code samples directly on the project details page 
7. Users can generate code for their project and edit it in the dedicated code editor
8. For individual files, users can use the "Generate with Claude" button to have AI create or improve specific files

## API Routes

The application includes several key API routes:

- `/api/generate-field`: Generates AI-powered content for specific form fields
- `/api/generate-plan`: Creates a comprehensive project plan based on user inputs
- `/api/search-competitors`: Finds similar projects for competitive analysis
- `/api/generate-code`: Generates starter code files based on project specifications
- `/api/generate-file`: Generates code for individual files using Claude 3.7
